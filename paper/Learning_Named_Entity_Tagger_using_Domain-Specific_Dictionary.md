# Learning Named Entity Tagger using Domain-Specific Dictionary
## Information
- 2018 Arxiv
- Shang, Jingbo, et al.

## Keywords
- NER
- AutoLabel
- Distant Supervision

## Contribution
- Propose AutoNER, a novel neural model with the new Tie or Break scheme for the distantly supervised NER task.
- Revise the traditional NER model to the Fuzzy-LSTM-CRF model, which serves as a strong distantly supervised baseline.
- Refine distant supervision for better NER performance.

## Summary
1. Fuzzy-LSTM-CRF with Modified IOBES
- Label with modified IOBES:
  Label the sequence with exact dictionary match by the format of modified IOBES scheme.

-  Fuzzy-LSTM-CRF:
 Maximizes the total probability of all possible label sequences by enumerating both the tags and IOBES all matched entity types

2. AutoNER with "Tie or Break"
- "Tie or Break" Tagging Scheme:
 It focuses on the ties between adjacent tokens, i.e., whether they are tied in the same entity mentions or broken into two parts

- AutoNER:
 - For entity span detection, build a binary classifier to distinguish Break from Tie, while Unknown positions will be skipped.
 - After obtaining candidate entity spans, we further identify their entity types, including the None type for non-entity spans.

3. Others:
- About "Unknown" Entities:
 - FuzzyCRF : consider all possible labels
 - AutoNER : skip it
- Corpus-Aware Dictionary Tailoring:
 Tailor the original dictionary to a corpus-related subset by excluding entities whose canonical names never appear in the given corpus.
