## Summary
Propose an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), including following Steps:

1. General-domain LM pre-training: 
	Learn a LM with Wikipedia articles.

2. Target task LM fine-tuning: 
	Fine-tune the LM on data of the target task with following tricks
	- Discriminative fine-tuning: 
	 Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, tune each layer with different learning rates
	- Slanted triangular learning rates(STLR):
	 First linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it according to the following update schedule

3. Target task classifier fine-tuning: 
	Add two linear blocks and fine-tuneing with the Classificationn data
	- Concat pooling:
	 Concatenate the hidden state at the last time step hT of the document with both the max-pooled and the mean-pooled representation of the hidden states over as many time steps as fit in GPU memory H = [h1, ..., hT]

	- Gradual unfreezing:
	 First unfreeze the last layer and fine-tune all unfrozen layers for one epoch. Then unfreeze the next lower frozen layer and repeat, until we fine-tune all layers until convergence at the last iteration.
	- Backpropagation through time(BPTT) for Text Classification (BPT3C)
	- Bidirectional language model
