## Information

- Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, and Piotr Doll´ar

## Keywords
- Focal Loss
- Object Detection

## Contribution
- Identify class imbalance as the primary obstacle preventing one-stage object detectors from surpassing top-performing, two-stage methods.
- Propose the focal loss which applies a modulating term to the cross entropy loss in order to focus learning on hard negative examples.

## Summary
- Propose a reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples to address class imbalance(hard or imbalance class).

- The Normal Cross Entropy (CE) Loss: (binary classification for example)

- The Balanced Cross Entropy Loss:

	, where α<sub>t</sub> represent that the weighting factor α∈[0,1] for class 1, and 1-α for class -1

	, where γ is the focusing parameter γ >= 0(in this paper γ use 2)
	- The focusing parameter γ smoothly adjusts the rate at which easy examples are downweighted.
	- γ = 0, FL is equivalent to CE
